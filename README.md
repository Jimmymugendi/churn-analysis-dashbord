# Churn Analysis Dashboard
### Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive Churn Analysis Dashboard tailored for the telecom industry. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention, offering valuable insights into customer demographics and churn risk. The goal is to empower proactive retention strategies rather than reactive measures.

### Project Highlights
* Industry Challenge: Retaining customers in the telecom sector is crucial; losing them is costly.
* Proactive Approach: Currently, customer retention efforts begin after contract termination, which is reactionary. This project aims to predict churn risk in advance, enabling timely intervention.
* Visual Insights: Moving away from traditional Excel-based analysis, this dashboard provides clear and actionable insights through intuitive visualizations that are self-explanatory for management.
